# raindicator
Raspberry Pi project to show the next hour's weather forecast as coloured light.

Want to know if it's about to rain? This project gets the weather forecast for
the immediate future from forecast.io (which powers darksky) and converts it to
a colour/luminosity setting for your Philips Hue.
